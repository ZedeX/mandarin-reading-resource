1. **Playback Progress Saving**: Automatically saves current playback position every 5 seconds
2. **Playback Completion Recording**: Records completed audio playback and play count
3. **Status Restoration**: Automatically restores last playback position when reopening the page
4. **Local Storage**: Uses browser localStorage to store playback status without uploading to server

### Display Information

Playback status information is displayed below each audio item:
- Unplayed audio: No information displayed
- Played but incomplete: Displays last playback time and completion percentage
- Completed playback: Displays play count and last playback time

### Storage Mechanism

Playback status information is stored in the browser's localStorage, with each audio file's status saved as an independent key-value pair without interference.
